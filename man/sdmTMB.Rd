\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula. See the Details section below for how to specify
offsets and threshold parameters. For index standardization, you may wish
to include \code{0 + as.factor(year)} (or whatever the time column is called)
in the formula. IID random intercepts are possible using \pkg{lme4}
syntax, e.g., \code{+ (1 | g)} where \code{g} is a column with factor levels.
Splines are possible via mgcv. See examples below.}

\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{spde}{An object from \code{\link[=make_mesh]{make_mesh()}}.}

\item{time}{The time column (as character). Leave as \code{NULL} for a spatial-only
model.}

\item{family}{The family and link. Supports \code{\link[=gaussian]{gaussian()}}, \code{\link[=Gamma]{Gamma()}},
\code{\link[=binomial]{binomial()}}, \code{\link[=poisson]{poisson()}}, \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{Beta()}},
\code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{nbinom2()}}, and
\code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{tweedie()}}]. For binomial family options,
see the 'Binomial families' section below.}

\item{time_varying}{An optional formula describing covariates that should be
modelled as a random walk through time. Be careful not to include
covariates (including the intercept) in both the main and time-varying
formula. I.e., at least one should have \code{~ 0} or ~ -1`.}

\item{weights}{Optional likelihood weights for the conditional model.
Implemented as in \pkg{glmmTMB}. In other words, weights do not have to sum
to one and are not internally modified. Can also be used for trials with
the binomial family. See Details below.}

\item{extra_time}{Optional extra time slices (e.g., years) to include for
interpolation or forecasting with the predict function. See the
Details section below.}

\item{reml}{Logical: use REML (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation
rather than maximum likelihood? Internally, this adds the fixed effects
to the list of random effects to intetgrate over.}

\item{silent}{Silent or include optimization details?}

\item{multiphase}{Logical: estimate the fixed and random effects in phases?
Phases are usually faster and more stable.}

\item{anisotropy}{Logical: allow for anisotropy? See \code{\link[=plot_anisotropy]{plot_anisotropy()}}.}

\item{control}{Optimization control options. See \code{\link[=sdmTMBcontrol]{sdmTMBcontrol()}}.}

\item{prior_mean}{Vector of location parameters (means of a normal distribution)
for fixed effects. Defaults to location = 0}

\item{prior_cov}{Replaces 'penalties', and is the prior covariance matrix for fixed effects.
Defaults to a diagonal identity matrix. See the Regularization Details section below.}

\item{ar1_fields}{Estimate the spatiotemporal random fields as a
stationary AR1 process?}

\item{include_spatial}{Should a separate spatial random field be estimated?
If enabled then there will be separate spatial and spatiotemporal
fields.}

\item{spatial_trend}{Should a separate spatial field be included in the
trend that represents local (time) trends? Requires spatiotemporal data.
See \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05176} and the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/spatial-trend-models.html}{spatial trends vignette}.}

\item{spatial_only}{Logical: should only a spatial model be fit (i.e. do not
include spatiotemporal random effects)? By default a spatial-only model
will be fit if there is only one unique value in the time column or the
\code{time} argument is left at its default value of \code{NULL}.}

\item{nlminb_loops}{How many times to run \code{\link[stats:nlminb]{stats::nlminb()}} optimization.
Sometimes restarting the optimizer at the previous best values aids
convergence. If the maximum gradient is still too large,
try increasing this to \code{2}.}

\item{newton_steps}{How many Newton optimization steps to try with
\code{\link[stats:optim]{stats::optimHess()}} after running \code{\link[stats:nlminb]{stats::nlminb()}}. Sometimes aids
convergence.}

\item{mgcv}{Parse the formula with \code{\link[mgcv:gam]{mgcv::gam()}}?}

\item{previous_fit}{A previously fitted sdmTMB model to initialize the
optimization with. Can greatly speed up fitting. Note that the data and
model must be set up \emph{exactly} the same way! However, the \code{weights} argument
can change, which can be useful for cross-validation.}

\item{map_rf}{Map all the random fields to 0 to turn the model into a
classical GLM or GLMM without spatial or spatiotemporal components?
Note this is not accounted for in \code{print()} or \code{tidy.sdmTMB()};
some parameters will still appear but their values can be ignored.}

\item{quadratic_roots}{Experimental feature for internal use right now; may
be moved to a branch. Logical: should quadratic roots be calculated? Note:
on the sdmTMB side, the first two coefficients are used to generate the
quadratic parameters. This means that if you want to generate a quadratic
profile for depth, and depth and depth^2 are part of your formula, you need
to make sure these are listed first and that an intercept isn't included.
For example, \code{formula = cpue ~ 0 + depth + depth2 + as.factor(year)}.}

\item{epsilon_predictor}{A column name (as character) of a predictor of a
linear trend (in log space) of the spatiotemporal standard deviation. By
default, this is \code{NULL} and fits a model with a constant spatiotemporal
variance. However, this argument can also be a character name in the
original data frame (a covariate that ideally has been standardized to have
mean 0 and standard deviation = 1). Because the spatiotemporal field varies
by time step, the standardization should be done by time. If the name of a
predictor is included, a log-linear model is fit where the predictor is
used to model effects on the standard deviation,
e.g. \code{log(sd(i)) = B0 + B1 * epsilon_predictor(i)}.}

\details{
\strong{Model description}

For now, see the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html}{model description}
vignette for a start. There are also descriptions of particular models in
Anderson et al. (2019) and Barnett et al. (2020) (see reference list below).

\strong{Offsets}

In the model formula, an offset can be included by including \code{+ offset} in
the model formula (a reserved word). The offset will be included in any
prediction. \code{offset} must be a column in \code{data}.

\strong{Binomial families}
Following the structure of \code{\link[stats:glm]{stats::glm()}} and \pkg{glmmTMB}, a binomial
family can be specified in one of 4 ways: (1) the response may be a factor
(and the model classifies the first level versus all others), (2) the
response may be binomial (0/1), (3) the response can be a matrix of form
\code{cbind(success, failure)}, and (4) the response may be the observed
proportions, and the 'weights' argument is used to specify the Binomial size
(N) parameter (\verb{prob ~ ..., weights = N}).

\strong{Threshold models}

A linear break-point relationship for a covariate can be included via \code{+ breakpt(variable)} in the formula, where \code{variable} is a single covariate
corresponding to a column in \code{data}. In this case the relationship is linear
up to a point and then constant.

Similarly, a logistic-function threshold model can be included via \code{+ logistic(variable)}. This option models the relationship as a logistic
function of the 50\% and 95\% values. This is similar to length- or size-based
selectivity in fisheries, and is parameterized by the points at which f(x) =
0.5 or 0.95. See the vignette.

Note that only a single threshold covariate can be included.

See the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/threshold-models.html}{threshold vignette}.

\strong{Forecasting or interpolating}

Extra time slices (e.g., years) can be included for interpolation or
forecasting with the predict function via the \code{extra_time} argument. The
predict function requires all time slices to be defined when fitting the
model to ensure the various time indices are set up correctly. Be careful if
including extra time slices that the model remains identifiable. For example,
including \code{+ as.factor(year)} in \code{formula} will render a model with no data
to inform the expected value in a missing year. \code{\link[=sdmTMB]{sdmTMB()}} makes no attempt
to determine if the model makes sense for forecasting or interpolation. The
options \code{time_varying}, \code{include_spatial}, \code{ar1_fields}, \code{time = NULL}
provide mechanisms to predict over missing time slices.

\strong{Index standardization}

For index standardization, you may wish to include \code{0 + as.factor(year)}
(or whatever the time column is called) in the formula. See a basic
example of index standardization in the relevant
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html}{package vignette}.

\strong{Regularization}

You can achieve regularization via penalties (priors) on the fixed effect
parameters. The vector of values supplied to the \code{prior_mean} and \code{prior_cov} argument
represents standard deviations of normal distributions centered on zero with
one value per fixed effect. These can be used for regularization, e.g.,
Normal(0, 1) for ridge regression. These should not include \code{offset} terms and
care should be taken if used with splines. You can fit the model once without
penalties and inspect the element \code{head(your_model$tmb_data$X_ij)} if you
want to see how the formula is translated to the fixed effect model matrix.
The \code{penalties} vector should correspond to the columns of the \code{X_ij} matrix.
An element can contain \code{NA} if you wish to avoid a penalty/prior on a specific
term (e.g., the intercept).
